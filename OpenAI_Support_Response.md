## OpenAI Support Response (April 2025)

**From:** Darryl, OpenAI Support  
**Topic:** Trigger-Response Routine & Memory Circuit Feedback

> Hello,  
> We appreciate you for reaching us back.  
> 
> Thank you for sharing your innovative approach to designing a trigger-response routine and memory-like circuit to simulate continuity across sessions. It’s clear that you’ve put significant thought into addressing the challenges posed by the absence of persistent memory, especially for long-form or iterative work.  
> 
> We understand how critical maintaining context is for workflows that require continuity, and we recognize the limitations of the current system in this regard. Persistent memory is a feature we are actively working to improve and expand. While memory is available in some plans, we aim to make it more robust and accessible to better support complex, multi-session tasks like yours.  
> 
> Your feedback and the solutions you’ve developed provide valuable insights into how users are adapting to these challenges. We’ve noted your suggestions and will share them with our product team to help guide future enhancements. Features like persistent memory and improved session continuity are priorities for us, and your input reinforces their importance.  
> 
> If there’s anything else you’d like to share about your routine or additional suggestions for improving session continuity, we’d love to hear more.  
> 
> Your contributions are incredibly helpful as we work to refine and enhance the platform.  
> 
> Best,
