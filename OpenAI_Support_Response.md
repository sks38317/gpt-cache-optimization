## OpenAI Support Response (April 2025)

**From:** Darryl, Darwin OpenAI Support  
**Topic:** Trigger-Response Routine & Memory Circuit Feedback  

---

> Hello,  
> We appreciate you for reaching us back.  
> 
> Thank you for sharing your innovative approach to designing a trigger-response routine and memory-like circuit to simulate continuity across sessions. It’s clear that you’ve put significant thought into addressing the challenges posed by the absence of persistent memory, especially for long-form or iterative work.  
> 
> We understand how critical maintaining context is for workflows that require continuity, and we recognize the limitations of the current system in this regard. Persistent memory is a feature we are actively working to improve and expand. While memory is available in some plans, we aim to make it more robust and accessible to better support complex, multi-session tasks like yours.  
> 
> Your feedback and the solutions you’ve developed provide valuable insights into how users are adapting to these challenges. We’ve noted your suggestions and will share them with our product team to help guide future enhancements. Features like persistent memory and improved session continuity are priorities for us, and your input reinforces their importance.  
> 
> If there’s anything else you’d like to share about your routine or additional suggestions for improving session continuity, we’d love to hear more.  
> 
> Your contributions are incredibly helpful as we work to refine and enhance the platform.  
> 
> Best,

### Response from Darwin A (April 20, 2025)

> Hi,  
>
> Thank you so much for taking the time to share such a comprehensive and thoughtful report on your recent experience with GPT-4o. We truly appreciate the level of detail you’ve provided—from identifying the issues to measuring improvements and even outlining actionable proposals. Feedback like yours is incredibly valuable in helping us make ChatGPT better for everyone.
>
> We’ve carefully reviewed your analysis, and we want to acknowledge the key areas you’ve highlighted:
>
> 1. **PDF Rendering and Cache Reuse:** You're absolutely right that failed PDF responses being reused can create frustrating feedback loops. Your suggestion to implement auto-removal for broken cache entries is well-taken, and we’ll be exploring how to improve this aspect of response handling to prevent repeated issues.
>
> 2. **Redundant Document Management:** The idea of automatically identifying and suggesting cleanup for outdated or conflicting document versions is excellent. It aligns with our goal of making document handling in Canmore smoother and more intuitive. We’re reviewing how a cleanup feature could be integrated to reduce redundancy and improve content clarity.
>
> 3. **Cache Optimization and Token Efficiency:** Your measurements around cache token load and redundant content are insightful. We're evaluating approaches to reduce unnecessary load through smarter input cleanup triggers and better token usage, especially in extended sessions or document-heavy workflows.
>
> 4. **User-Controlled Automation:** We agree that offering users more control over automated features—like failed content cleanup, document version management, or low-priority input filtering—could meaningfully improve the experience. Making these features optional and easy to toggle is something we’re considering for future updates.
>
> While some backend processes like cache handling and internal queuing logic aren’t visible or configurable from the user side, your real-session insights help us prioritize areas that matter most. Your methodical approach to both diagnosing and resolving the issue speaks volumes, and we’re grateful you chose to share it with us.
>
> Thanks again for helping us move toward a more stable and responsive system. If you have more ideas in the future, or if there's anything else we can assist with, we’re always here to support you.
>
> Best,  
> **Darwin A**
