# GPT Cache Optimization Report v2.0  
*– Empirical System Improvement Analysis –*

---

## 1. Purpose and Overview  
This report summarizes a user-driven intervention to stabilize a GPT session affected by repetitive errors and cache overload.  
The goal is to quantify performance improvements related to PDF failure loops, redundant document retention, and token overflow through direct measurement.

---

## 2. Problem Definition  
- PDF rendering failures are misinterpreted by GPT as successful responses.  
- These failed responses are stored in cache and reused, causing response loops.  
- Edited documents are stored alongside previous versions, leading to content conflict.  
- Cache overload results in delayed or impaired GPT response performance.

---

## 3. Measurement Methodology  
**Session Activity Period:** April 10–11, 2025  
→ Primary GPT usage, document handling, cache conflict incidents  
**Measurement & Induced Test Date:** April 16, 2025  
→ Manual simulation of error cases, retry loop reproduction, and performance benchmarking  

**Method:** Manual message tracking and log-based measurement  
**Metrics Tracked:**  
- PDF loop occurrence  
- Retry frequency  
- Redundant document presence  
- Cache token count  
- Response delay rate  

> *Token estimation based on system output length and user perception.*

## 4. Environment & Conditions  
- **Model:** GPT-4o (ChatGPT mobile app, April 2025)  
- **Platform:** ChatGPT official Android app  
- **OS:** Android 12 (Device: Galaxy Tab S series)  
- **Network:** Wi-Fi (no connection lag observed)  

**Unknown Variables:**  
- Session cache capacity limits  
- Cache prioritization algorithm  
- Internal response queuing logic  

> *These elements are outside user access and not directly measurable.*

---

## 5. Measurement Results (Before Stabilization)  
- **PDF loop frequency (per hour):** 4+ times (including retries)  
- **Repeated response attempts:** 4–6 occurrences  
- **Redundant document count (Canmore):** 5–6 average  
- **Cache token load:** ~17,000–18,500 tokens  
- **Redundant phrase rate in cache:** ~22%  
- **Response delay:** Detected post-PDF attempts

---

## 5.1. Measurement Results (After Stabilization)  
- **PDF loop frequency (per hour):** Reduced to 2 (50% decrease)  
- **Repeated response attempts:** Limited to 2 or fewer  
- **Redundant document count (Canmore):** Reduced to 3 or fewer  
- **Cache token load:** Below 14,200 (13.7% reduction)  
- **Redundant phrase rate in cache:** Below 7%  
- **Response delay:** Eliminated

## 5.2. Summary Comparison (Before vs After)

| Metric                         | Before                   | After                  | Change      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------|

## 6. Technical Proposal Summary  
1. **Auto-removal of failed PDF responses**  
   → Prevent reuse of broken cache entries in future attempts  
2. **Redundant document cleanup system**  
   → Automatically suggest deletion or queue cleanup of older versions  
3. **Low-frequency input cleanup triggers**  
   → Improve token efficiency and reduce memory clutter  

---

## 7. Conclusions and Expansion Points  
This empirical report is based on a real GPT user session and presents a practical application of automated optimization logic.  
For full deployment as a system-level proposal, the following areas should be refined:

a. Detailed explanation of GPT cache handling mechanics  
b. Full disclosure of model and backend configuration  
c. Automation algorithm mapping (e.g., cleanup queue flow)  
d. User-selectable automation control system  
→ Users should be able to toggle automation features at session start  
(e.g., auto-delete failed PDFs, auto-remove old documents, filter low-priority content)

> ※ This item is based on logic actually applied in the user session and can be modularized for system-level implementation.

## 8. Supplementary Commentary  

**Also, if it’s not too much trouble**—would it be possible to use one of the contact methods I shared for any future replies?  
Just asking because, as a K-grade 12 student in CSAT (a.k.a. 수능) mode, destroying my F5 key isn’t exactly part of my ideal study routine.

**"Additionally,"** it might be useful to allow users to retain a limited number of previous document versions—such as 1 or 2—rather than automatically deleting all old versions. Ideally, this could be made configurable, letting users set how many versions to keep.

> *As this report was prepared at the cost of my study time, I sincerely hope it will be reviewed with appropriate seriousness.*

## 9. Post-Submission Feedback Commentary

**Reply to 'steps you can take to mitigate the issue':**

> I understand the recommendation to break longer reports into smaller submissions.  
> However, since GPT typically treats each submission as a single-response thread, splitting the report can lead to fragmented context and inefficient feedback loops.  
> That’s why I chose to submit it as a single, complete document. So I suggest you to add function for this.  
> 
> Also, starting a new session deletes the conversation history, which seriously disrupts my workflow when working on documents.  
> 
> This is actually why I designed a trigger-response routine and memory-like circuit to simulate continuity across sessions—as I mentioned in my initial report.  
> The absence of persistent memory made it difficult to maintain context over time, especially during long-form or iterative work.
