# GPT Cache Optimization: A Real-World Case Study

This repository documents a real-time cache failure scenario, memory continuity challenge, and optimization workaround—discovered and tested by a general ChatGPT user through hands-on simulation and problem analysis.

While working on multi-session GPT simulations, the user encountered persistent PDF generation failures, token overflow loops, and cache redundancy issues. Rather than stop, they measured, analyzed, and proposed a full optimization solution—complete with system behavior logs, trigger-response circuits, and quantifiable metrics.

## Key Highlights

- Token reduction metrics after optimization
- Memory-like routine via user-designed trigger-circuit logic
- Auto-deletion logic for failed system responses
- Real system usage scenario with measured performance gains
