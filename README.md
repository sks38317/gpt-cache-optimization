# GPT Cache Optimization: A Real-World Case Study

This repository documents a real-time cache failure scenario, memory continuity challenge, and optimization workaround—all discovered and tested by an 18-year-old Korean CSAT student.

While working on multi-session GPT simulations, the user encountered persistent PDF generation failures, token overflow loops, and cache redundancy issues. Rather than stop, they measured, analyzed, and proposed a full optimization solution—complete with system behavior logs, trigger-response circuits, and quantifiable metrics.
